## Frequently Asked Questions

### What types of projects do you take on?

I work on projects ranging from focused consulting engagements (a few weeks) to ongoing technical partnerships (months to years). Typical projects include:

- Ontology development and curation
- Knowledge graph design and implementation
- Semantic mapping and data integration
- Establishing FAIR data practices
- Training and capacity building

### What is your availability?

My availability depends on the scope and nature of your project. I rarely have capacity earlier than 3 months in advance, so please get in touch early if you're planning a larger engagement.

### Do you work with industry clients?

Yes. While much of my work is with research organizations and NGOs, I also work with industry clients, particularly in biotech, pharma, and data-intensive sectors. The same principles of open standards and sustainable practices apply.

### What are your rates?

Rates depend on the scope and nature of the work. I provide detailed proposals with transparent pricing after an initial discovery conversation.

### Can you provide references?

Yes. I'm happy to connect you with past clients who can speak to their experience working with me.
