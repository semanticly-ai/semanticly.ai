Most of my work falls into four areas. In practice, projects often combine several—a knowledge graph needs an ontology; an ontology needs mappings to external resources; mappings need infrastructure to stay current.

I'm not precious about boundaries. If you're not sure which service fits, just describe your problem—we'll figure out the right approach together.
