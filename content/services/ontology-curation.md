## The Problem

Ontologies need constant attention: new terms to add, definitions to refine, classifications to fix, external resources to align with. Traditional curation is slow, inconsistent, and doesn't scale. But fully automated approaches produce garbage that experts don't trust.

The solution is systematic curation that combines AI-powered extraction with human judgment—documented, evidence-backed, and quality-controlled.

## What You Get

A sustainable curation workflow: clear patterns defining what belongs in your ontology, systematic extraction from your sources, evidence documentation for every term, and quality checks that catch problems before release. AI accelerates the work; humans stay in control.

## How It Works

### 1. Define Content Patterns and Scope

We establish what your ontology should contain:

- **Content patterns**: What types of terms belong? (e.g., infectious diseases follow one pattern, Mendelian diseases another)
- **Scope boundaries**: What's in, what's out? Where does your ontology end and others begin?
- **Relationship templates**: How should terms connect to each other and to external resources?

These patterns become executable—used to validate new content and guide extraction.

### 2. Identify Information Sources

We determine where curation content comes from:

- **Literature**: Papers, reviews, clinical guidelines
- **Databases**: Existing resources like OMIM, Orphanet, UniProt
- **Other ontologies**: Terms to import or align with
- **Expert knowledge**: Domain specialists on your team

For each source, we define relevance criteria: what information matters for your patterns?

### 3. Extract and Document Evidence

As we curate, we build evidence dossiers:

- **Provenance tracking**: Every term knows where it came from—PubMed ID, database entry, expert assertion
- **AI-assisted extraction**: LLMs and NLP to identify candidate terms, definitions, and relationships from literature
- **Evidence compilation**: Supporting citations and references attached to each piece of curated content

This isn't just good practice—it's what makes your ontology trustworthy and maintainable.

### 4. Integrate into the Ontology

We incorporate curated content through established workflows:

- **Pattern-based validation**: New terms checked against defined patterns before integration
- **ODK workflows**: Standard tooling for adding terms, running reasoners, generating releases
- **Review gates**: Human approval for AI-suggested content, with clear accept/reject/modify workflows

Integration is systematic, not ad-hoc. Every addition follows the same process.

### 5. Identify and Address Gaps

Curation is ongoing. We establish processes to surface issues:

- **Gap analysis**: Missing terms, incomplete classifications, outdated definitions
- **Quality reports**: Automated checks that flag problems for curator attention
- **Issue tracking**: Standardized workflows for reporting and resolving curation gaps
- **Continuous improvement**: Regular review cycles to keep the ontology current

## Why This Approach

Curation fails when it's undocumented (no one knows why terms exist), inconsistent (different curators do different things), or unsustainable (one person's head holds all the knowledge).

Our methodology makes curation explicit: patterns define what belongs, evidence documents why, and workflows ensure consistency. AI scales the extraction; humans make the decisions. The result is an ontology your community can trust—and maintain—long-term.

## Tools We Use

- **[Ontology Development Kit (ODK)](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit)**: Standardized workflows and quality control
- **[ROBOT](http://robot.obolibrary.org/)**: Command-line ontology operations
- **LLM integrations**: AI-assisted term extraction, definition drafting, and classification suggestions
- **Custom curation interfaces**: Simple UIs for domain experts who don't need to learn ontology tooling
