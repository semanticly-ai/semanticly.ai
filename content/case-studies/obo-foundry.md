## The Challenge

The [Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry](https://obofoundry.org/) is a collaborative effort comprising 50+ ontologies used throughout the life sciences. While each ontology serves its community, inconsistent practices across projects hindered interoperability and increased maintenance burden.

Key challenges included:

- Varied release practices and versioning schemes
- Inconsistent metadata and documentation
- Different quality standards across ontologies
- Lack of shared tooling and workflows

## Our Role

As co-lead of the OBO Foundry Technical Working Group, we spearheaded initiatives to standardize practices across the community.

### Ontology Development Kit (ODK)

We developed and maintain the [Ontology Development Kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit), a Docker-based toolbox that provides:

- **Reproducible builds**: Same tools, same versions, same results
- **Standardized workflows**: Common Makefile targets for release, validation, etc.
- **Quality control**: Automated checks for OBO Foundry principles compliance
- **CI/CD templates**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and release

The ODK has been adopted by **120+ ontologies worldwide**.

### OBO Academy

We co-founded [OBO Academy](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/), a community resource that:

- Consolidates training materials and tutorials
- Documents best practices and standard operating procedures
- Hosts a seminar series on semantic engineering topics
- Provides a reference for new ontology developers

### Standards Development

We contributed to OBO Foundry standards including:

- Metadata specifications for ontology registration
- Quality metrics and automated validation
- Guidelines for community contribution workflows
- Registry system improvements

## Outcomes

- **120+ ontologies** now use ODK, up from a handful in 2020
- **Standardized releases** across major OBO ontologies
- **Reduced maintenance burden** through shared tooling
- **Improved interoperability** through consistent practices
- **Community knowledge sharing** via OBO Academy

## Broader Impact

The OBO Foundry's approach to open, interoperable ontologies has become a model for other scientific communities. Our work helps ensure this ecosystem remains sustainable and continues to deliver value to researchers worldwide.
