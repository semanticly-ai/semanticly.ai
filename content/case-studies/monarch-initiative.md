## The Challenge

The [Monarch Initiative](https://monarchinitiative.org) is an international collaboration that integrates data from diverse sources—including model organisms, human disease databases, and genomic resources—to enable researchers to discover relationships between genes, diseases, and phenotypes.

Managing the ontological infrastructure for such a vast, multi-source knowledge graph requires:

- Consistent phenotype representation across species
- Continuous alignment with evolving external resources
- Scalable curation workflows for community contributions
- High-quality, well-documented releases

## Our Role

As lead of the ontology engineering working group, our responsibilities included:

### Unified Phenotype Ontology (uPheno)

We developed and maintain [uPheno](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/upheno.html), an integrated ontology that enables cross-species phenotype comparison. This involved:

- Coordinating with multiple species-specific ontology communities
- Developing shared design patterns for phenotype representation
- Building automated pipelines for ontology integration
- Establishing quality control processes

### Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) Infrastructure

For [HPO](https://hpo.jax.org), the standard for human phenotypic abnormalities, we:

- Developed the automated release system with continuous integration
- Implemented standardized versioning and metadata
- Created multi-lingual versions to support global adoption
- Established quality validation pipelines

### Cross-Ontology Alignment

We built frameworks for maintaining alignment between Monarch's ontologies and external resources, using:

- Automated matching algorithms
- Human-in-the-loop review workflows
- SSSOM-based mapping management

## Outcomes

- **uPheno** now integrates phenotypes from multiple species, enabling novel cross-species disease associations
- **HPO** release process reduced from manual, error-prone steps to automated, validated workflows
- Ontology infrastructure supports **millions of phenotype annotations** in the Monarch knowledge graph
- Community contribution workflows enable sustainable maintenance

## Technologies Used

- Ontology Development Kit (ODK)
- ROBOT
- GitHub Actions
- OWL/RDF
- SSSOM
