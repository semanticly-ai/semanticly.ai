## Nicolas Matentzoglu, PhD

I'm a semantic engineering specialist with over 10 years of experience in ontology development, knowledge graph infrastructure, and FAIR data integration. My work focuses on designing collaborative, open systems that support global data interoperability.

I am particularly interested in projects that use modern AI approaches (LLM's, agentic AI) for scaling up data and knowledge curation while recognising the importance of keeping humans in the loop - which, for me, does not just mean they are "informed" and "accountable" (e.g. as reviewers of selected pieces of content), but also continuously trained and "up-skilled" on their own mental models of the problem domain to _stay in control of their own knowledge_.

Based in Athens, Greece, I work remotely with teams worldwide—from research institutions and NGOs to industry partners building next-generation data infrastructure.

### Background

**Education**:
- PhD in Computer Science, University of Manchester (2011-2015)
  - Thesis: "Module-based classification of OWL ontologies"
  - EPSRC-funded research
- Diplom in Media Informatics and Law, University of Cologne (2005-2010)

**Experience**:
- Independent Consultant at semanticly.ai (2020 - Present)
- Senior Semantic Web Developer at European Bioinformatics Institute (2018 - 2020)
- Research Associate at University of Manchester (2014 - 2017)

I've co-authored **30+ peer-reviewed publications** and contribute actively to open source tooling for the semantic web community.

## Work Philosophy

### Collaborative Remote Work

I work remotely and continuously strive to achieve the highest possible effectiveness of collaborative work in teams scattered across all time-zones. Clear communication, documented decisions, and asynchronous-friendly workflows are essential.

### Enabling Others

I regularly teach hands-on semantic technologies to audiences from industry and academia to enable them to perform complex knowledge engineering tasks autonomously. The goal is to make myself redundant—your team should be able to maintain and extend what we build together.

### Agile Mindset

Most work should be people-first, iterative, and user-driven. We start with clear understanding of your needs, deliver incrementally, and adjust based on feedback. No multi-month black boxes.

### Open Data

I'm a strong believer in the value of open ontologies and promote contributions from industry to open data efforts. Where possible, I contribute tooling and training to Open Data initiatives—because the rising tide lifts all boats.
